msgid "Many professionals are increasingly embracing Debian GNU/Linux, whose goal to create a rich and flexible distribution that does not require too much maintenance fits their expectations. They generally appreciate its robustness and reliability, its automation of secondary tasks, as well as the coherence brought by the strict application of specifications and therefore the durability of achievements and skills."
msgstr "因为期望使用一种丰富又灵活且无需过多维护就能满足需求的发行版本，越来越多的专业人士正投入 Debian GNU/Linux 的怀抱。他们普遍赞赏其稳定性和可靠性，次要任务的自动化执行，以及严格规范的应用所带来的连贯性，并因此得到的成就和技能的长期可用性。"

msgid "At the same time, many influential actors in the computing industry have now come to understand the strategic interest of using an elaborate distribution that is not managed by a commercial entity. Some of their customers also understand — following the same logic — that a software platform that does not depend on agreements between suppliers reduces the constraints they will have after the purchase."
msgstr "同时，在计算机行业的许多有影响力的公司已经开始认识到使用一个精心制作的而不是由一个商业实体管理的发行版的战略意义。他们的一些客户也明白，遵循相同的逻辑，不依赖于供应商协议的软件平台，将会降低他们购买后的限制。"

msgid "Finally, many beginners discover Debian through the Knoppix and Ubuntu projects, while others “look under the hood” because they want to avoid empiricism."
msgstr "最后，许多初学者通过 Knoppix 和 Ubuntu 项目发现 Debian，因为他们想要避免经验主义又想看看它们的本质。"

msgid "Debian — which used to be low-profile — was first adopted by passionate users, who were often attracted by the spirit it embodies. They found a project with clear goals and visible achievements, whose developers focus on creating a good design <emphasis>before</emphasis> building — thereby rejecting the deadlines that often compromise the quality of so many other software projects. Debian is led by its very actors. In other words, Debian users join a project that fully benefits from the advantages of free software… so as to produce free software themselves."
msgstr "Debian 最早是被狂热用户接受，他们往往被它体现的精神所吸引。他们发现这个项目有明确的目标和可见的成果，开发者们在开发<emphasis>之前</emphasis>就致力于创造一个良好的设计，从而避免了其他许多软件项目的质量往往被最后期限所影响的问题。 Debian 是由自己所领导的。换句话说，Debian 用户加入一个充分受益于自由软件优势的项目，而又产生自由软件。"

msgid "The <citetitle>Debian Administrator's Handbook</citetitle> will guide you on your way to autonomy. It could only be written by authors who master both the technical aspects and the inner workings of the Debian project, and who know the needs of seasoned professionals as well as enthusiasts. Raphaël Hertzog and Roland Mas had the required qualities and managed to create and update this book. I thank them very much for their work and have no doubt that reading this book will be both helpful and pleasant."
msgstr "<citetitle>Debian 管理员手册</citetitle>将引导您掌控一切。只有同时掌握 Debian 项目的技术细节和内部运作，以及同时了解经验丰富的专业人士和爱好者的需求的人才能写得出这本书。Raphaël Hertzog 和 Roland Mas 具备这些素质，并努力创建和更新这本书。我非常感谢他们的工作，毫无疑问，读这本书将是有用且愉快的。"
