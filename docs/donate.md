# Donate to KISS

First off, thanks for considering donating to KISS.
We really appreciate the fact that you want to support KISS development.

However, before you make your payment, please read the following:

* **Don't donate if you can't afford what you're spending**. KISS is a passion project. I'm lucky enough to have a well-paid job and I don't *need* this money. So don't donate if it will take something away from you.
* **We appreciate your donation, but it will not give you any entitlement**. Feature development will happen depending on community feedback, and saying "I donated to KISS" will not increase the likelihood of us working on a particular feature. Once again, this is a passion project driven by the community, not by money!

If you still want to donate after reading all of the above&mdash;thank you so much!

In the spirit of open-source, we use Bitcoin to receive all donations.

Our Bitcoin wallet:

### How will my money be used?
KISS expenses are really minimal. Your money is likely going to be used to make:

* make KISS more well known in third-world countries that could benefit from a lightweight launcher.
* sponsor additional developments
* pay some developers for a coffee or a meal
* go to charities (ecology, animals, homeless shelters, open-source projects, NGOs...)
