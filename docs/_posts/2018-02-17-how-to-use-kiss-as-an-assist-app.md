KISS was built to be used as a launcher.
However, if you'd rather keep your default launcher and only use KISS for search, you can setup KISS to appear automatically when you long press the Home button. This is called an assist app in Android.

The way to achieve this differ slightly across Android versions, but the general gist is the same.

### Android 8
Open the system settings, then search for "assist app".

Click on the existing app ("Enhanced Google Services" in the screenshot), then select KISS.

### Android 7

Go to `Settings > Apps > Cog > Assist & voice input > Assist app`


Select KISS.

### Android 6

Go to `Settings > Apps > Cog > Default Apps > Assist & voice input > Assist app`.

Select KISS.

### Android 5

Go to `Settings > Apps > Google App (Or current default app) > CLEAR DEFAULTS`

Then hold home and select KISS as default
