KISS has a lot of settings, and sometimes updating multiples settings together can have unexpected side-effects. In other situations, you may need to completely restart the app to pick up the new settings.

KISS does its best to automatically refresh itself when changing settings, but if you're not seeing the changes you're expecting you can force a reboot of KISS by going to `â‹®, KISS Settings, Advanced Settings, Restart KISS`.

> Please note that if you're using KISS as an assist app, and not as a launcher, this will just quit the app and you'll need to re-open KISS manually.
