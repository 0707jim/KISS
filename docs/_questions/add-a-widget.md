KISS only supports widget in `Minimalistic UI`.

## Enable `Minimalistic UI`

From the settings, enable `Minimalistic UI` (`⋮, KISS Settings, User Interface, Enable minimalistic UI`).

While you're there, you may want to enable some other settings in `Minimalistic UI` section to make sure you're happy with the end result;

Go back to KISS by pressing the Home button on your device.

## Add a widget
Press the three-dots menu again `⋮`. You should now see a new option in the contextual menu, "Add widget":

From there, pick a widget, and the widget will appear on top of an empty search bar.

To remove the widget, press `⋮` again and select "Remove widget".

## Limitations
Currently, the widget feature:

* Does not allow resizing
* Does not allow multiple widgets
