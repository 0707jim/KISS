With KISS Launcher, you can unclutter your home screen and access the functions you need as fast as possible.

Features:
* 4 WORDS: Keep it simple, stupid
* UNDER 250 KB : Small sized
* SAVE BATTERY LIFE: Optimized battery drain
* NEW EXPERIENCE: Experience Android in a new way
* SMART SEARCH: Find everything that you need
* FAST USAGE: Faster than ever
* PRIVACY FIRST: KISS does not have Internet access. Your data never leaves your phone.

KISS was developed to save you time and the battery on your smartphone.

KISS Launcher helps you find the most used features of your phone, and adapts continuously to your usage.

Search through your apps, contacts and settings lightning fast. No more time spent trying to find the app you want to launch: type a few characters and press enter. Need to call someone? Don't meddle with the call log, just type three letters of their name and tap the “phone” button. What you won't see is a lame grid of application icons that sit there doing NOTHING.

KISS becomes smarter and smarter as you use it, suggesting results you're more likely to select.

If you're used to Spotlight, Alfred, the Windows search bar or Gnome's dash menu, you'll feel right at home.
