msgid "Debian is a very successful operating system, which is pervasive in our digital lives more than people often imagine or are aware of. A few data points will suffice to make this clear. At the time of writing Debian is the most popular GNU/Linux variant among web servers: according to W3Techs, more than 10% of the web sites are Debian-powered. Think about it: how many web sites would have you missed today without Debian? Onto more fascinating deployments, Debian is the operating system of choice on the International Space Station. Have you been following the work of ISS astronauts, maybe via the social network presence of NASA or other international organizations? Both the work in itself and the posts that brought you the news have been delivered to you via Debian. Countless companies, universities, public administrations, etc. rely on Debian daily for their operations, delivering services to millions of users around the world... and its orbit!"

msgid "But Debian is actually way more than just an operating system, no matter how complex, featureful, and reliable such a system is. First of all, Debian is a vision of the freedoms that people shall enjoy in a world where more and more of our daily activities are implemented via software. Debian is born from the cardinal Free Software idea that people should be in control of their computers, rather than the other way around. People with enough software knowledge should be able to dismantle, modify, reassemble, and share with others all the software that matters to them, be it used for frivolous activities such as posting pictures of kittens on the Web, or for potentially life-threatening tasks such as running our cars or the medical devices which treat us. People without enough software knowledge, on the other hand, shall be able to find people they trust, people of their choice, to audit devices on their behalf."

msgid "In the quest for the control of people over machines, Free operating systems play a fundamental role. You cannot be in full control of a computer device if you do not control its operating system. This is where Debian's main ambition comes from: producing the best, entirely Free operating system. For more than 20 years now, Debian has not only developed a Free operating system, but also promoted a vision of Free Software, setting a very high bar for software freedom advocates around the world. Debian's decisions on matters of software licensing, for example, are routinely looked up to by international standard organizations, governments, and other Free Software projects, when deciding if something should be considered “free enough” or not."

msgid "But this political vision is not yet enough to explain Debian's uniqueness. Debian is also a very peculiar social experiment. Think for a moment of other mainstream Free Software distributions, or even of popular <emphasis>proprietary</emphasis> operating systems. Chances are that you can associate each of them with a large company that is either the main development force behind the project, or at the very least the steward of all its non-development activities. Debian is different. Within the Debian Project volunteers pick on themselves the responsibilities of all the activities that are needed to keep Debian alive and kicking. The variety of those activities is stunning: from translations to system administration, from marketing to management, from conference organization to artwork design, from bookkeeping to legal issues, ... not to mention software packaging and development! Debian volunteers take care of all of these, driving their own boat. This radical form of independence has many important consequences. One is that Debian needs a very diverse community of volunteers, capable of offering to the Project a wide range of skills. Another consequence is that Debian's choices can be trusted not to be driven by the commercial interests of specific companies — interests that we have no guarantee will be always be aligned with the goal of promoting people's control over machines (as too many recent examples in the news testify)."

msgid "One last aspect contributes to Debian's uniqueness: the way in which the social experiment is run. Despite the folklore of being bureaucratic, decision making in Debian is in fact highly unstructured, almost anarchic. There exist clearly defined areas of responsibility within the project. People in charge of those areas are free, once again, to drive their own boat. As long as they keep up with the quality requirements agreed upon by the community, no one can tell them what to do and how to do their job from the outside. If you want to have a say on how something is done within Debian, you need to be able to put yourself on the line, and volunteer your time to take the job on your shoulders. This peculiar form of meritocracy — which we sometimes call <emphasis>do-ocracy</emphasis> — is very empowering for contributors, as anyone with enough skills, time, and motivation can have a real impact on the direction the project is taking. This is testified by a population of about 1 000 official members of the Debian Project, and several thousands of contributors world-wide. It is no wonder that Debian is often credited as the largest community-driven Free Software project in existence."

msgid "So Debian is quite unique. Are we the only ones noticing this? Definitely not. According to DistroWatch there are about 300 active Free Software distributions around. Half of that (about 140) are Debian <emphasis>derivatives</emphasis>. That means that those distributions start from Debian, modify it for the specific needs of their target users — usually by adding, modifying, and rebuilding Debian packages — and distribute the result to their users. In essence, derivatives apply the Free Software granted freedoms of modifying and redistributing modifying copies not only to individual pieces of software, but to a distribution as a whole. The potential of reaching out to new Free Software users and contributors by the means of an ecosystem of distributions based on one another is huge. We believe that it is mainly thanks to that thriving ecosystem that Free Software is nowadays finally rivaling with proprietary software alternatives in fields which were historically considered hard to conquer, such as large desktop deployments. Debian sits at the root of the largest ecosystem of Free Software distributions in existence: even if you are not using Debian directly, and even if your distributor has not told you, chances are that you are benefiting right now from the work of thousands Debian contributors around the world."

msgid "But Debian's uniqueness sometimes comes with unexpected consequences. A consequence of Debian's vision on digital freedoms has been the need of redefining what we mean by <emphasis>software</emphasis>. The Debian Project has since long realized that, as part of an operating system, you need to distribute quite a lot of non-software material: music, images, documentation, raw data, firmware, etc. But how do you apply <emphasis>software</emphasis> freedoms to that material? Should we have different requirements or should all material be held up to the same high standard of freedom? The Debian Project has decided for the latter: all material shipped as part of Debian should offer the same freedoms to its users. Such a radical philosophical position has far reaching effects. It means we cannot distribute non-free firmware, or artwork not meant to be used in commercial settings, or books that cannot be modified in order to avoid tarnishing (as book publisher folklore goes) the author/publisher reputation."

msgid "The book you have in your hands is different. It's a <emphasis>free as in freedom</emphasis> book, a book which is up to Debian freedom standards for every aspects of your digital life. For a very long time, the scarce availability of books like this one has been a significant shortcoming of Debian. It meant that that there was little book-like material that help spreading Debian and its values, while at the same time embodying those values and showing off their advantages. But it also meant, ironically, that we had little such material that we could distribute as part of Debian itself. This is the first reputable book to address this shortcoming. You can <command>apt-get install</command> this book, you can redistribute it, you can fork this book or, better, submit bug report and patches for it, so that other in the future can benefit from your contributions."
